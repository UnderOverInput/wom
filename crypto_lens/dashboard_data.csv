Kenji is a shy, part-time moderator for OZ, the virtual reality world that powers everyday life, until pretty and popular Natsuki recruits him to be her fake boyfriend. While posing as an affluent suitor to Natsuki's family, Kenji finds that a rogue A.I. program has stolen his online identity, and Kenji is accused of hacking OZ and causing real-world catastrophes. As the destruction in OZ throws Natsuki's family into disarray, Kenji must unite his newfound connections to overcome an impending cyber apocalypse.

Against a backdrop of stunning countryside vistas and virtual spaces bursting with color, Summer Wars is a timeless epic that explores life in the digital age from Academy Award®-nominated* director Mamoru Hosoda (BELLE).

― Scripture Readings: Genesis 1:1-5 · Psalm 148:1, 3, 9-14 · Romans 8:19-23 
 
― For reflection: 
1. We believe that God is present in all of creation although his presence is sometimes difficult to perceive. 
2. Creation is a gift of God subjected to suffering, often inflicted by human beings. How can we better recognize our responsibility for its care and preservation? 
3. If possible, spend some time in nature and contemplate how it connects us with the Creator.

Nicaragua:

Suspension of Refugee Admissions: On January 20, 2025, President Trump signed an executive order suspending the admission of refugees under various programs, including ""Safe Mobility,"" for 90 days. This suspension impacts many Nicaraguan exiles who had hoped to resettle in the United States. 

Cuba:

Termination of Humanitarian Parole Program: The Trump administration has ended the humanitarian parole program that allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela to enter the United States legally and stay for up to two years, provided they had a U.S.-based supporter. 

Venezuela:

Reinstatement of Oil Sanctions: In April 2024, the Biden administration reinstated broad oil sanctions against Venezuela due to unfulfilled promises for free elections. These sanctions targeted officials and increased rewards for capturing leaders, including President Nicolás Maduro. 

Immigration Crackdown: The Trump administration has intensified immigration enforcement, targeting Venezuelans and creating uncertainty about deportations. 

These actions reflect the administration's approach to addressing political and humanitarian concerns in these countries."

Its a time consuming complex process that includes a thorough investigation of both parties involved by immigration prior to approval. Any hint of impropriety by either and its automatically denied. Its far from a guaranteed method of gaining a path to citizenship. 

The best method remains having completed education and excelled in a field for which there’s significant demand in the US and applying to US corporations to secure sponsorship of a work visa. As an in demand high value applicant there’s more potential benefits for the US brought to the table in favor of being granted a path to citizenship."

$IRS,0.05,Mon Jan 27 18:54:13 +0000 2025,"From Grok

The Inspector General (IG) report findings on IRS audits under President Biden's administration have been subject to various interpretations. Here's an overview based on available information:

- **Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen's Directive**: There was a directive from Yellen that IRS funding should not increase the share of small businesses or households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels. This was intended to focus enforcement on higher-income earners and large corporations.

- **Criticism and Claims**: Some sources, including Republican leaders and posts on X, have claimed that despite Yellen's directive, 90% of new IRS audits targeted individuals earning less than $400,000 annually. However, these claims are not conclusively supported by official reports available through web sources.

- **Official Reports**:
  - A report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) mentioned the IRS's struggle to implement the $400,000 directive without increasing audit rates for those below this income level. However, it did not explicitly state that 90% of audits targeted those under $400,000.
  - Another TIGTA report discussed the effectiveness of audits on higher-income brackets but did not specify that 90% of audits were on lower-income groups.
  - The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and other analyses suggested that without specific protections, there could be an increased likelihood of audits for middle-class taxpayers under the new IRS funding, but they did not confirm the exact percentage of such audits.

- **Public Perception vs. Official Data**: There's a noticeable gap between public discourse on social platforms like X, where claims of a 90% audit rate on lower-income individuals are made, and the official data or reports which do not explicitly corroborate this figure. 

In conclusion, while there are criticisms and concerns about the focus of IRS audits under the Biden administration, especially regarding the possibility of increased scrutiny on middle-class taxpayers, the exact claim of ""90% of IRS audits under Biden’s IRS went after people making less than 400,000 per year"" is not directly substantiated by the available official reports. Instead, this appears to be more of a sentiment echoed in some political and social media circles, potentially influenced by broader debates on tax policy and enforcement."
